[Google Data Analytics Capstone Project](/pages/Bellabeat Case Study.html)

I recently completed Google's data analytics course. In this case study, I imagine that I am a junior data analyst working for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health focused products for women. In this scenario, Bellabeat is interested in analyzing and supplementing non-customer user data from other fitness wearables in order to inform decisions in marketing its products more effectively. To accomplish this task, I utilize Python in Jupyter notebooks to clean data, perform exploratory data analysis, and create basic predictive models with machine learning techniques.

[Mathematical Modeling Covid Hospitalizations](/pages/Covid_Modeling.html)

<img src="images/AZ_covid_predictions.png?raw=true"/>

In this project, I collect, clean, and analyze data relating to COVID cases in Arizona. Next, I look into using scipy packages to model the first spike in hospitalizations using the SIHR system of differential equations. Further research can be done here by implementing machine learning techniques to learn this model's parameters.

[Deep Learning for Multi-Class Classification](/pages/Multiclass.html)

<img src="images/momentum_loss.png?raw=true"/> 

This project is an extension of a homework assignment from a mathematics of deep learning class. Here, I explore the use of momentum in deep learning, practice the basics of object oriented programming, and finish by building a neural network to predict classes of wine. The wine classification occurs in number 5. Here, we use Pytorch with CrossEntropyLoss to build a model that can predict between 3 different types of wines.

[Housing Price Regression with Pytorch](/pages/Housing.html)

<img src="images/housing_image.png?raw=true"/> 

This project is the result of another class assignment, and represents my first time building a neural network with Pytorch. In the final problem of this assignment, I use a deep learning network to predict housing prices using the boston housing dataset.

[Various Mathematics Projects](https://github.com/JeffUyekawa/JeffUyekawa)

<img src="images/julia_set.png?raw=true"/>
This is a collection of projects related to my study in my Masters program in Mathematics. If you're feeling particularly "Math-y" and want to explore some more rigorous, theoretical mathematics projects, have a look!

### Upcoming Projects

<img src="images/google_badge.png?raw=true"/> 
I recently completed Google's data analytics course. I am currently working on a case study, and once finished, I will add a jupyter notebook documenting the data analysis process as well as a powerpoint presentation that I would present to stakeholders.
