### Recent Projects

[Mathematical Modeling Covid Hospitalizations](/pages/Covid_Modeling.html)

<img src="images/AZ_covid_predictions.png?raw=true"/>

In this project, I collect, clean, and analyze data relating to COVID cases in Arizona. Next, I look into using scipy packages to model the first spike in hospitalizations using the SIHR system of differential equations. Further research can be done here by implementing machine learning techniques to learn this model's parameters.

[Deep Learning for Multi-Class Classification](/pages/Multiclass.html)

<img src="images/momentum_loss.png?raw=true"/> 

This project is an extension of a homework assignment from a mathematics of deep learning class. Here, I explore the use of momentum in deep learning, practice the basics of object oriented programming, and finish by building a neural network to predict classes of wine. The wine classification occurs in number 5. Here, we use Pytorch with CrossEntropyLoss to build a model that can predict between 3 different types of wines.

This is a collection of projects related to my study in my Masters program in Mathematics. If you're feeling particularly "Math-y" and want to explore some more rigorous, theoretical mathematics projects, have a look!
